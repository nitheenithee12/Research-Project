This project different set of Notebooks.

1: We have tested differnt types of networks, and picked one which suites our requirements.
2: After selecting best model, we have produced coordinates in this file.
3: we took the network and Developed a Reinforcement Learning model to pick the best long range links in the network according to network Parameters. (Please Refer the link provided to know more details.)
4: One of the notebook has code to calculate QOS.
5: Code in this file is used to test the results against other models out there in the industry.

1 -> Types_Network
2 -> Network_deployment
3 -> Copy_of_Untitled8
4 -> QOS
5 -> Test_Notebook
